\section{Objectives}

Intramolecular decay processes in electronically excited organic
molecules are dominated by the structure of triplet states
\cite{mcglynn69, medvedev95}.  Triplet states are low in energy
relative to singlet electronic states, due to the quantum mechanical
effects of exchange splitting.  Triplet states are long-lived
(metastable), due to the selection rule $\Delta S = 0$ for optical
transitions to the ground state.

Triplet states are a difficult target for spectroscopists, since they
are optically inaccessible from the ground state.  Although they are
less well understood than their singlet counterparts, they are perhaps
more important to study from a chemical stanpoint.  The long lifetimes
($\tau > 30$ \microsec) and chemically significant internal energies
($E_T > 30,000$ \rcm) of triplet molecules make them important
chemical reaction intermediates \cite{calvert66}.  Triplet electronic
states are often populated unintentionally in collisions with excited
molecules, and their electronic structure may impact the outcome of a
chemical reaction \cite{woodward71}.


Intersystem Crossing (ISC) is the dynamical manifestation of mixing
between singlet and triplet excited states \cite{robinson67,
  kommandeur87, lombardi88, tramer05}.  ISC is understood primarily as
a statistical process, where an electronically excited state decays
into a bath of undistinguished triplet states.  The general behavior
of ISC is categorized by the product of the average singlet-triplet
matrix element, $\langle H_{sm} \rangle$, and the local density of
triplet states, $\rho_m$ \cite{robinson67, kommandeur87, freed76}.  When
$\langle H_{sm} \rangle \rho_m \ll 1$, the system is said to be in the
``small-molecule limit.''  In the small molecule limit,
singlet$\sim$triplet mixing may often be treated as a two-level
problem, and the properties of the individual singlet and triplet
levels may be determined by deperurbation.  When $\langle H_{sm}
\rangle \rho_m \gg 1$, the system approaches the ``large molecule
limit.''  In this case, the density of triplet states is so large that
the natural width of singlet-mixed eigenstates exceeds the average
energy spacing.  The problem of singlet$\sim$triplet mixing is treated
in a statistical manner, based on the average properties of the
triplet levels.  When $\langle H_{sm} \rangle \rho_m \approx 1$, the
system is in the ``intermediate case,'' characterized by mixing
between a singlet level and a number of discrete triplet levels.

For many molecules, the dynamics of intersystem crossing cannot be
classified simply by one of the schemes above.  A more general
``tier'' model is proposed to understand the dynamics of systems where
some of the mixing occurrs indirectly in the zero-order picture
\cite{stuchebrukhov93a, stuchebrukhov93b}.  Such a situation is found
in the acetylene molecule, where vibrational levels of the $T_3$
electronic state mediate mixing between the first excited singlet
state, $S_1$, and the remaining triplet states, $T_{1,2}$.  At
energies below the first dissociation limit, the product $\langle
H_{S_1 T_3} \rangle \rho_{T_3}$ is much less than 1.  Thus, $S_1 \sim
T_3$ mixing is categorized in the small molecule limit.  Conversely,
the product $\langle H_{T_3 T_{1,2}} \rangle \rho_{T_{1,2}}$ is on the
order of 1.  Mixing between the first and second tiers is categorized
in the intermediate case.

In the limit of small $T_3$ level density, the tier model simplifies
to a ``doorway-mediated'' model.  In most cases, one vibrational level
of $T_3$, called the doorway state, dominates the $S_1 \sim T_3$
mixing.  In this thesis, the doorway model for intersystem crossing is
examined and characterized for cases where the $T_3$ doorway state is
non-degerate with the perturbed $S_1$ level.

\section{Spectroscopic investigations of acetylene triplet states}

The first experimental detection of acetylene in the triplet state was
reported by Burton and Hunziker in 1972 \cite{burton72}.  They
produced triplet acetylene molecules by collision with excited mercury
atoms, themselves produced by absorption of 254 nm radiation from a
mercury resonance lamp.  This process is called mercury
photosensitization, and has been known to photochemists since the
1920's \cite{cairo22}.  Triplet acetylene was detected in the
experiments by collisional excitation of biacetyl, which emits
phosphorescence in the visible region of the spectrum \cite{burton72}.
The energy of triplet acetylene was estimated to be roughly 2.6-4.7
eV.

Subsequent experiments investigated the geometry of triplet acetylene.
The spectrum of a triplet-triplet transition in the near infrared was
observed by Wendt and coworkers \cite{wendt79}.  The triplet acetylene
was again produced by a method of mercury photosensitization.  The
spectrum was assigned to the only allowed triplet-triplet transition
among the low-lying electronic states of acetylene, $\tilde{d} \;
^3A_2 \leftarrow \tilde{a} \; ^3B_2$.  This confirmed the existence of
the predicted lowest energy triplet state, \emph{cis}-bent $\tilde{a}$
$^3B_2$.  Subsequently, Lisy and Klemperer used a low-energy electron
gun to produce metastable acetylene molecules in an effusive beam,
which they detected via electron ejection from a cesium surface
located 80 cm downstream \cite{lisy80, hemminger76}.  They measured a
negligible electric dipole moment for the lowest energy metastable
triplet state, consistent with a \emph{trans}-bent structure at
approximately 4.7 eV.

The relative energies of the observed \emph{cis} and \emph{trans}
triplet states were the subject of some debate, due to the two
apparently conflicting observations.  The apparent disparities are
explained by the fact that spin-orbit perturbations high vibrational
levels of the ground state are electronically allowed for the
\emph{cis}-bent state, but only vibronically allowed for the
\emph{trans}-bent state \cite{lundberg93}.  Since the \emph{cis}-bent
triplet is more efficiently mixed with high vibrational levels of the
ground state, it is less efficiently detected via electron emission
from a metal surface.  The observation of Lisy and Klemperer is
therefore consistent with the \emph{ab initio} determination that the
lowest triplet state of acetylene is \emph{cis}-bent
\cite{lundberg93}.

Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) has provided some more recent
low-resolution information on the linear triplet structures
\cite{dressler87, swiderek97}.  Assignments of the \emph{cis} and
\emph{trans}-bent triplet states in condensed phase EELS of acetylene
is in general agreement with the theory, which we review in the next
section \cite{malsch98}.


\section{Survey of the low-lying triplet electronic states of
  acetylene: \emph{ab initio} calculations}

% \POINT{Summarize the electronic structure of the acetylene valence
%   triplet states.  Show molecular orbitals and energy level diagrams.}
% \POINT{Discuss the change in geometry, cis and trans wells.}

The valence electronic states of acetylene result from the promotion
of one electron from a bonding $\pi$ orbital to an antibonding $\pi^*$
orbital.  Figure \ref{fig:mol-orbitals} shows the principal molecular
orbital configurations for the four lowest energy excited electronic
states of acetylene \cite{yamaguchi93}.  The in-plane antibonding
orbital, $\pi^*(a_g)$, is stabilized by a change in \ce{CCH} bond
angle, while the out-of-plane antibonding orbital is not
\cite{walsh53, demoulin75, wetmore78}.  Balanced against the
destabilization of fully filled $\sigma$-bonding orbitals, this effect
gives rise to potential energy minima in \emph{cis}-bent and
\emph{trans}-bent geometries for the low-lying electronic states of
acetylene, $S_1$, $T_1$, $T_2$, and $T_3$.

    (3\sigma_g)^2$, are not shown.  The $S_1$ and $T_3$ electronic
    states differ by one antibonding spin orbital.}

\section{A heirarchy of electronic coupling in acetylene: evidence from
  Zeeman anticrossing experiments}

A series of Zeeman Anticrossing (ZAC) experiments, carried out by
Dupr\'{e} and coworkers, established a heirarchy of
singlet$\sim$triplet mixing in acetylene \cite{dupre91, dupre93,
  dupre95a, dupre95b}.  The mixing is controlled by the relative
magnitudes of matrix elements between electronic states.  The
conclusions of the Dupr\'{e} ZAC experiments are of fundamental
importance to the work in this thesis.  We summarize the experiments
in some detail.

In a Zeeman anticrossing experiment, the excitation laser is fixed on
an optical transition terminating in a nominally singlet rovibronic
level of the molecule.  As a magnetic field is increased,
triplet-mixed levels tune through resonance with the singlet.
Relative to the singlet level at $E=0$, the energy of a mixed triplet
level is (by the linear Zeeman effect)
\begin{equation}
  E = g \, M_s \, \mu_B \, (B-B_0),
\end{equation}
where $g$ is the mixed-triplet level's $g$-factor, $M_s$ is the
lab-fixed projection of spin, $B_0$ is the field required to bring the
level's energy to 0, and $\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton
\cite{lombardi88}.  An excited electron that is not coupled to the
molecular axis (Hund's case ($b$) limit) has a $g$-factor of $2.0023$.
When the singlet level and one of the weakly interacting background
levels are tuned to exactly the same energy by the magnetic field,
they become 50:50 mixed.  Under these circumstances, half the
molecules excited in the experiment decay by collision instead of
fluorescence, and the fluorescence intensity decreases by 50\%.  The
\emph{width} of the resonance is proportional to the matrix element
between the bright state and the interacting level:
\begin{equation}
  \Delta B = \frac{4\,V}{g\,\mu_B}.
\end{equation}

Dupr\'{e} and coworkers measured the $0-8$ T anticrossing spectra of
the $J'=0$, $K'=0$ rovibronic levels in $S_1$ $\nu_3'=0-3$
\cite{dupre91}.  They observed a rapid increase in the density of
mixed-triplet levels with excitation in $\nu_3$.  Becuase the observed
density of states is larger than number of $T_{1,2}$ levels, they
conclude that the triplet levels must mix with and contaminate the
denser manifold of $S_0$ levels.  However, increased $T_{1,2} \sim
S_0$ coupling does not by itself make more mixed-triplet levels
accessible to cross with the $S_1$ level.  The $S_1$ level can only
undergo triplet-mediated mixing with $S_0$ levels over an energy range
on the order of the $S_1 \sim T$ matrix element.  Therefore, they
conclude that coupling between $S_1$ and a subset of the triplet
levels $T$ must increase to make the dense manifold of contaminated
$T_{1,2} \sim S_0$ levels observable in the experiment.

A rapid increase in anticrossing linewidth with excitation in $\nu_3$
was observed in the same study \cite{dupre91}.  Since the linewidth is
proportional to the $S_1 \sim T$ matrix element, this supports the
conclusion that the $S_1 \sim T$ coupling is increasing with
excitation in $\nu_3$.  Accounting for both observations, the authors
are able to exclude several possible mechanisms for the increase in
anticrossing density.  Direct $S_1 \sim S_0$ internal conversion is
ruled out because it cannot account for a sudden increase in
vibrational overlap integrals between relatively unmixed $S_1$ levels
and essentially fully mixed $S_0$ levels, over the energy range of the
study.  The possibility that $S_0$ dissociation limit may increase the
total density of states is ruled out because the increase in state
density would be accompanied by a decrease in vibrational overlap
integrals.

In further studies, Dupr\'{e} and coworkers undertook the individual
analysis of approximately 60 anticrossings from the $\nu_3'=0-2$
spectra \cite{dupre95a}.  The analysis reveals a large variation in
measured $g$ factors, which implies that the $T_{1,2}$ levels are
highly mixed.  Mixing between triplet states according to the
selection rule $\Delta M_S = \pm 1$ causes the $g$ factors to vary
from the expected value of $2$.  Strong $S_0 \sim T_{1,2}$ mixing is
ruled out, because it would cause the $g$ factors to be close to zero.
The authors also observed that all quantum beat frequencies vary as a
function of field strength \cite{dupre95a}.  Direct mixing (``internal
conversion'') between $S_1$ and $S_0$ is therefore ruled out, because
it would cause the frequencies of quantum beats to be approximately
constant as a function of magnetic field strength ($M_S=0$ for all
singlet levels).

In the final paper of the series, Dupr\'{e} derives the product
$\rho_{vib} \cdot \langle V \rangle$ from the Fourier transform of
anticrossing spectra for $\nu_3=0-4$ \cite{dupre95b}.  They determined
that the product $\rho_{vib} \cdot \langle V \rangle$ increases
exponentially from $0\nu_3$ to $4\nu_3$.  The density of states does
not increase appreciably over this energy range, so the effect must
arise from an increasing matrix element.

The authors proposed an order of interaction strengths: $T_1 \sim T_2
\gg S_1 \sim T \gg S_1 \sim T_{1,2} \gg S_0 \sim T_{1,2} \gg S_1 \sim
S_0$.\footnote{The authors do not explicity state the inequality $S_1
  \sim T \gg S_1 \sim T_{1,2}$, but it is implied by the rapid
  increase in anticrossing density with excitation in $\nu_3'$.}  The
first inequality is supported by the large variation in measured $g$
factors \cite{dupre95a}.  The inequality $S_1 \sim T_{1,2} \gg S_0
\sim T_{1,2}$ allows for the large number of $S_0$ levels detected in
the ZAC experiments \cite{dupre91}.  The third inequality, $S_0 \sim
T_{1,2} \gg S_1 \sim S_0$, states that the internal conversion process
from $S_1$ to $S_0$ is triplet-mediated, as supported by the variation
in quantum beat frequncies with magnetic field \cite{dupre95a}.

Dupr\'{e} and Green characterized a wide anticrossing in the
$\nu_3'=3$ $J'=0$ $K'=0$ level \cite{dupre93}.  Thom and coworkers
provide a useful summary of this experiment in their recent article
\cite{thom07}.  A $T_3$ level with energy $\Delta E = \pm 6.67$
cm$^{-1}$ interacts with the $J=K=0$ level of $3\nu_3$ \cite{thom07,
  dupre93}.  This strong interaction is very well characterized by the
Zeeman anticrossing data.  Many weak anticrossings with nominal $S_0$
levels can be seen perturbing the strong $S_1 \sim T_3$ anticrossing.
The zero-field $S_1 \sim T_3$ matrix element is $0.29$ cm$^{-1}$ if
$K_{T_3}=0$, or $0.58$ if $K_{T_3}=1$.

The authors propose two mechanisms to explain the rapid increase in
anticrossing density with excitation in $\nu_3'$: a $S_1 \sim T_3$
curve crossing, and a $T_2$ linear isomerization barrier.  Under the
first mechanism, the observed $S_1 \sim T$ coupling is induced by a
sparse collection $T_3$ levels, most of which are located outside the
tuning range of the magnetic field.  Under the second proposed
mechanism, the $T_2$ linear isomerization barrier causes the
vibrational overlap between $T_2$ levels in the \emph{cis}-well and
$S_1$ levels in the \emph{trans}-well to increase in the region of the
linear turning point.  Although the second mechanism is energetically
possible, subsequent \emph{ab initio} calculations rule out the linear
$T_2$ barrier in favor of the first mechanism \cite{vacek96,
  sherrill96, cui96, cui97, ventura03}.

% The main conclusions are summarized as follows.
% \begin{inparaenum}
% \item Mixing between $T_{1}$ and $T_2$ dominates the intramolecular
%   dynamics in the energy region of the study, evidenced by widely
%   varying local Land\'{e} g-factors ($0.3-2.0$).
% \item The $T_1 \sim T_2$ coupling strength increases only slightly
%   over the energy range of $0\nu_3'-2\nu_3'$.  This is evidenced by an
%   observed decrease in the average Land\'{e} g-factor with energy.
% \item Mixing between the $S_1$ and $S_0$ electronic states is not the
%   result of direct internal conversion, but is induced by the mixed
%   $T_{1,2}$ levels.
% \item There is a rapid increase in $S_1 \sim T_{1,2}$ mixing in the
%   range of $0\nu_3'-2\nu_3'$, mediated by a special class of triplet
%   levels, $T$.  Matrix elements between $T$ and $S_1$ mediate the $S_1
%   \sim T_{1,2}$ mixing.
% \end{inparaenum}
% These observations led the authors to propose a heirarchy of of
% interactions between the electronic states of acetylene:
% \begin{equation}
%   T_1 \sim T_2 \gg S_1 \sim T \gg S_0 \sim T \gg S_1 \sim S_0
% \end{equation}



\section{Doorway-mediated intersystem crossing in acetylene: evidence
  from laser-induced fluorescence and quantum beats}

The $T_3$-mediated doorway model of acetylene singlet$\sim$triplet
mixing is further supported by measurements of laser-induced
fluorescence and quantum beats.  Ochi and coworkers recorded LIF
spectrum of the $3^2$ \Ka{1}, $3^3$ \Ka{1}, and $3^4$ \Ka{1} sublevels
of $S_1$ acetylene, measuring fluorescence lifetimes and the magnetic
field dependence of quantum beats for each observed line
\cite{ochi91}.  They observe that the singlet-triplet mixing is
strongest for the $3^3$ \Ka{1} level, which is near-degenerate to a
$S_1 \sim T_3$ surface crossing.

The 1994 study of Drabbels and coworkers is perhaps the only
experiment, aside from ZAC measurements, to record a fully resolved
spectrum of the $3^3$ \Ka{1} and $3^4$ \Ka{1} sublevels
\cite{drabbels94}.  They attribute the splittings in the spectrum to
direct $S_1 \sim T_{1,2}$ mixing, but this interpretation is
inconsistent with the fact that direct $S_1 \sim T_{1,2}$ mixing
cannot account for the profound changes in singlet-triplet mixing over
the 44,000$-$46,000 \rcm\ energy range.  Subsequent analysis has shown
that the Drabbels spectrum contains evidence for a local $S_1 \sim
T_3$ perturbation, which mediates the $S_1 \sim T_{1,2}$ mixing
\cite{altunata01}.

Recent investigations in our laboratory have led to the observation of
more triplet-perturbed levels in $S_1$ acetylene, as a fortunate side
effect in the deperturbation of the non-symmetric bending polyads
\cite{merer08, steeves08}.  Levels containg excitation in the
non-symmetric bending modes are of particular interest, because motion
along these coordinates may promote or reduce $S_1 \sim T_3$
vibrational overlap integrals.  Further information about the
non-symmetric bending modes, $\nu_4$ and $\nu_6$, would shed new light
on the nature of $S_1 \sim T_3 \sim T_{1,2}$ dynamics.

\section{Detection of laser-excited metastables by surface electron
  ejection}

The experimental technique of Surface Electron Ejection by
Laser-Excited Metastables (SEELEM) was developed by Ofer Sheh and Ori
Cheshnovsky to study intermediate-case ISC in organic molecules such
as aniline and isoquiniline \cite{sneh86, sneh88, sneh89a, sneh89b,
  sneh91}.  It is based on the well-established, more general
technique of metastable detection by electron ejection from surfaces
\cite{hotop96}.  The use of laser excitation to populate metastable
states in SEELEM is somewhat paradoxical, because by definition,
direct optical transitions to such states are strongly forbidden.  The
method of SEELEM detection sidesteps the problem of weak optical
transitions by maintaining a low level of background electron signal.

In essence, the SEELEM detector consists of a grounded metal surface
and an electron multiplier.  To eject an electron from the grounded
metal surface of the SEELEM detector, a molecule must possess a
vertical excitation energy in excess of the work function, $\Phi$, of
the metal.  A gold surface was used in most of the experiments
described in this thesis, $\Phi = 5.1$ eV.  Sneh and coworkers have
shown that excess vibrational energy in the molecule does not affect
the SEELEM sensitivity \cite{sneh86}.  The exception that proves the
rule is the \ce{NO} molecule, where vibrations in the excited state
have a drastic impact on the dipole moment\cite{white05}.

The SEELEM technique was applied to the study of smaller molecules by
Wodke and coworkers \cite{price92, drabbels95, morgan96, humphrey97}.
The SEELEM apparatus at MIT was designed and built by Kevin Cunningham
and Selen Altunata, first as a single-chamber experiment, and later as
a differentially-pumped, two-chamber experiment
\cite{cunningham-thesis, altunata-thesis}.  The apparatus was refined
by subsequent workers, such as Ryan Thom, who re-engineered the
mounting and electrical connections for the detector itself
\cite{thom-thesis}.

Previous acetylene SEELEM experiments have focused on the $3\nu_3'$
\Ka{1} sublevel of the $S_1$ electronic state.  Humphrey \emph{et.
  al.} observed an enhancement in SEELEM intensity for rotational
lines of $3\nu_3'$ \Ka{1} with $J' < 4$ \cite{humphrey97}.  They
attributed this effect to interference with a near-degenerate
vibrational sublevel of the $T_3$ electronic state.  The nature of
$S_1 \sim T_3$ interference effects in the SEELEM spectrum of this
sublevel was investigated further by Selen Altunata, who demonstrated
the relationship between the relative energy of the perturbing $T_3$
level and moments of the SEELEM intensity distribution
\cite{altunata00}.  Mishra and Thom provided new SEELEM assignments
and carried out a deperturbation of the perturbing triplet sublevel
using a reduced term value plot and an effective Hamiltonian fit
\cite{mishra04}.

A schematic diagram of the current LIF/SEELEM arrangement is shown in
Figure \ref{fig:apparatus}.  Laser radiation in the UV is provided by
the frequency doubled output of an Nd:YAG-pumped dye laser.  The laser
radiation enters the vacuum chamber (not shown), and crosses the path
of the molecular beam, indicated by a dashed line, approximately 2.5
cm downstream from a pulsed nozzle.  Fluorescence is gathered by $f$/4
optics at the point of laser excitation, passes through a UG-11
filter, and is collected by a photomultiplier tube (PMT).
Laser-excited metastable molecules travel through a 3 mm diameter
skimmer and into a second, differentially pumped vacuum chamber.
Approximately 34 cm from the point of laser excitation, the
metastables collide with the metal surface of the SEELEM detector, and
ejected electrons are collected by an electron multiplier, located
immediately below the metal surface.

\section{Summary}

In this thesis, we investigate singlet$\sim$triplet mixing in the
acetylene molecule beyond the $\nu_3'=0-4$ levels.  In most cases, the
$T_3$ vibrational levels responsible for mediating $S_1 \sim T_{1,2}$
mixing are not observed in the spectrum.  Relating these spectra to
the doorway model requires new theory, new types of experiments, and
new analysis techniques.

In Chapter 2, we develop several frameworks for the problem of
doorway-mediated intersystem crossing.  Using these frameworks, the
relative statistical properties of LIF and SEELEM intensity
distributions are derived for several doorway-coupling model
Hamiltonians.

Moving beyond statistical properties, Chapter 3 demonstrates that a
doorway-coupling model Hamiltonian can be determined directly from the
spectral data by applying the standard LKL deconvolution technique in
a recursive manner.

% Chapter 4 presents a new and extended analysis of the well-studied but
% incompletely characterized $3\nu'_3$ vibrational level of $S_1$
% acetylene, highlighting experimental evidence for a new model of
% doorway-mediated coupling.  The new model proposed for $3\nu'_3$
% includes two doorway states: one distant doorway state with a large
% matrix element controls the overall coupling strength, while another
% local doorway with a smaller matrix element is responsible for
% splittings at low values of the rotational quantum number $J$.

In Chapter 4, we report experimental results for a number of $S_1$
vibrational levels.  The complex interplay between bending vibrations
and singlet$\sim$triplet mixing is apparent from the drastically
different LIF/SEELEM spectra obtained.  We discuss the ubiquitous role
of $T_3$ in mediating $S_1 \sim T_{1,2}$ coupling in light of these
results.

Chapter 5 presents the results of IR-UV double resonance SEELEM
experiments, which reveal similar Singlet-Triplet coupling
characteristics for the torsion and antisymmetric in-plane bending
motions.

We depart from our study of acetylene in Chapter 6, where a new method
is considered for the production of metastable molecules in a
molecular beam.  The basis of this method is two-photon optical
pumping of metastable atoms followed by electronic excitation transfer
in collisions.  The selection rules and transition probabilities for
two-photon excitation of the atoms are discussed for mercury and
xenon.  The model for collisional exitation transfer is based on a
curve-crossing model developed by Ottinger and coworkers for the
reaction of metastable \ce{Xe}* with \ce{N2}.  

Chapter 7 concludes and reviews the prospects for future research.
