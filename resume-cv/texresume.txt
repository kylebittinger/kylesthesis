  & Developed mechanistic models to describe
  the rich information encoded in high-resolution molecular spectra.
  Recorded spectra of the acetylene molecule using a variety of experimental
  techniques, such as laser-induced fluorescence, double resonance, and
  surface electron ejection by laser-excited metastables (SEELEM).
  Interpreted simultaneously recorded datasets in terms of hierarchical
  interactions between short-lived (singlet) and long-lived (triplet) 
  excited electronic states.
  Investigated these mechanisms as they relate to bending motions in the 
  molecule.
  Enhanced and extended the method of Lawrance-Knight spectral
  deconvolution to deduce the energy and matrix element of a mediating
  ``doorway'' triplet state from the experimental data.
  Modeled molecular systems involving statistical ensembles of triplet 
  states using the NumPy and SciPy libraries for Python.

  Measured the angular distribution of $H_2^+$ formed in the reaction of 
  $H_2$ with metastable $He^*$ atoms, using mass spectrometry. 
  Interpreted the results in the framework of classical scattering theory. 
  Modified and ran \textsc{Fortran} programs to simulate the experiment 
  and predict ion distributions.\\
