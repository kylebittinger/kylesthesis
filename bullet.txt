Here are some awesome acetylene-related things the Triplet project has
done in the last three years:

* SEELEM/LIF spectra of (2^1 3^1 4^2) and (2^1 3^1 6^2) K=1
  (the JPC paper)

* IR-UV double resonance spectra of (3^3 6^1) and (3^3 4^1) K=0:
  SEELEM spectra over ~10 cm-1 without overlap from neighboring lines

* IR-UV double resonance: observation of rotationless level using
  polarization

* Bryan & Ryan's T3 calculation, FC factors

* Better 3n3 data out to higher J', statistical analysis to confirm
  double doorway hypothesis (underway)

* Lawrence-Knight-Lehmann-Kyle (LKLK) deconvolution



Extra Spectra: Last winter, we recorded a bunch of high quality SEELEM
spectra during our hunt for bending polyad members. I am still trying
to fit these into a complete picture.

* SEELEM spectrum of (3^2 4^2)
  with lone SEELEM peak in band gap

* SEELEM spectrum of (4^1 6^3)
  (Feb 02) very weak

* SEELEM spectrum of (2^2 3^1)
  when we thought it was (3^2 4^2)

* SEELEM spectrum of (2^1 3^2) P, Q-branch 
  (Jan 16A,B)

* SEELEM spectrum of (4^3) K=2 hot band
  (Jan 16A) -- need to check this in Watson's atlas

* SEELEM spectrum of (3^3) K=2 hot band
  (Jan 22C)
