\chapter{A pulsed supersonic jet source of molecules in long-lived,
  electronically excited states
%: electronic energy transfer in
%  atom*-molecule collisions
}

\section{Introduction}


It is our goal develop a supersonic jet source of molecules in
long-lived, electronically excited states.  Although molecular triplet
states are hard to populate optically, they are easily generated in
collisions with other electronically excited species.  Such methods
are familiar to photochemists, who use the process of mercury
photosentization to create free readicals and other reactive species
\cite{brown89, brown88, crabtree92, cvetanovic64, phillips74,
  strausz70}.  A common technique is to place mercury and reactants in
a heated reaction vessel, and irradiate with 254 nm light from a
mercury resonance lamp \cite{brown87}.

The process of mercury photosensitization was used in the first and
second experimental detections of acetylene triplet states
\cite{burton72, wendt79}.  Later, Kanamori and coworkers used mercury
photosensitization to study the \emph{cis}-$T_2$ $\leftarrow$
\emph{cis}-$T_1$ absorption spectrum of acetylene \cite{kanamori07} in
the near IR spectral region.

The main drawback to the use of a traditional mercury
photosensitization technique with acetylene is polymer formation
\cite{shida58, leroy44}.  Another problem with traditional techniques
of mercury photosensitization is the complicated dynamics of radiation
trapping and energy pooling \cite{menningen00, herd05, majetich89,
  majetich91}.

The rate of polymer formation could be kept to a minimum if the number
density of mercury atoms could be carefully controlled.  In addition,
we would like to design a method where the particular atomic
metastable state could be selected based on the desired electronic
energy.  Furthermore, we wish to carry out experiments in a molecular
beam, so that rotational and vibrational cooling can concentrate the
population of triplet molecules into a relatively small number of
rovibronic states.

We describe a method to generate large numbers of metastable atoms in
the early stages of a supersonic expansion, without polymer formation.
The metastable atoms are populated by a technique of optical pumping
via two-photon transitions.  We first discuss the details of
two-photon transitions in atoms, and weigh the various options for
optical pumping.  A simple curve-crossing model is described for
atom*-molecule collisional excitation transfer.  We demonstrate the
general principles of the technique for the \ce{Xe}* + \ce{N2} system,
and then report progress on \ce{Hg}* + \ce{C2H2}.

\section{Theory: Optical pumping of atomic metastables via two-photon
  transitions}

Our initial goal is to populate metastable excited states of mercury
and xenon atoms.  The lowest-energy excited state term of both atoms
is $^{1,3}P$.  
%  arising from a $6s6p$ configuration in mercury and a
% $5p^56s$ configuration in xenon.
The $^{1,3}P$ term contains two metastable levels, $^3P_0$ and
$^3P_2$.  In this section, we examine the level structure of mercury,
formulate methods to populate the metastable $^3P_0$ and $^3P_2$
levels, and calculate transition probabilities for the proposed
excitation schemes.

Excitation of one electron into a $6p$ orbital gives rise to four
energy levels in mercury: $6 \; ^3P_0$, $6 \; ^3P_1$, $6 \; ^3P_2$,
and $6 \; ^1P_1$.  For brevity, we hereafter omit the principal
quantum number from the mercury $6 \; ^{1,3}P$ levels.  The matrix of
spin-orbit interaction within the $^{1,3}P$ term is
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
%  \begin{array}{c} \\ ^3P_2 \\ ^3P_1 \\ ^1P_1 \\ ^3P_0 \end{array}
%  \begin{array}{cccc} \\
%   \left [ 
%     \begin{array}{c} 1     \\ \; \\ \;  \\ \;  \end{array} 
%     \begin{array}{c} \;    \\ -1 \\ \sqrt{2} \\ \; \end{array}  
%     \begin{array}{c} \;    \\ \sqrt{2} \\ 0  \\ \; \end{array}  
%     \begin{array}{c}  \\  \\  \\ -2  \end{array}  
%   \right ] \cdot \zeta_{6s6p}/2,
 \begin{array}{cccc}^3P_2 & ^3P_1 & ^1P_1 & ^3P_0\end{array}
 \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\\
H^{SO} \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\: = \:\:\:
    \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 0 & 0 & 0  \\
     0 & -1 & \sqrt{2} & 0 \\   
     0 & \sqrt{2} & 0 & 0 \\ 
     0 & 0 & 0 & -2 \\  
    \end{bmatrix}
  \cdot \zeta_{6s6p}/2\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where the spin-orbit constant, $\zeta_{6s6p}$, is approximately 4265
\rcm\ \cite{field04}.  The $^3P_1$ state is contaminated with singlet
character, giving it a relatively short lifetime of $\sim$125 ns.  The
$^3P_2$ and $^3P_0$ levels have no spin-orbit interaction pathway to
the singlet, and are metastable.  The lifetimes of the $^3P_0$ and
$^3P_2$ states are so excessively long that experimental measurement
is difficult \cite{wexler80}.  Theoretical predictions for the
lifetimes of the $^3P_0$ and $^3P_2$ states in odd isotopes are on the
order of 1.0 and 0.5 s, respectively \cite{mishra01}.

The metastable triplet levels may be populated by spontaneous radiative
decay from singlet$\sim$triplet mixed levels at higher energy.  We
examine a series of potential two-photon excitation schemes, which
result in population of one or both metastable levels, $^3P_0$ and
$^3P_2$.  Many of the high-lying atomic levels which radiate directly
to $^3P_0$ and $^3P_2$ have been carefully studied, and accurate
branching ratios are available \cite{benck89}.  Two especially
promising candidates are $6 \; ^3D_2$ and $7 \; ^3S_1$.  The $6 \;
^3D_2$ level has a branching ratio of approximately 3:1:1 among the
$^3P_1$, $^3P_2$, and $^1P_1$ levels \cite{benck89}.  Thus, it is
suitable to populate the higher-energy metastable level, $^3P_2$.  The
$7 \; ^3S_1$ level radiates only to levels within the $^3P$ multiplet,
with a branching ratio of 1:2:2 among the $^3P_0$, $^3P_1$, and
$^3P_2$ levels \cite{benck89}.  Both metastable levels may be
populated via radiative decay from $7 \; ^3S_1$.

A general formula for the calculation of two-photon transition
probabilities is derived by Bonin and McIlrath \cite{bonin84}.
Starting from the atomic ground state, $\ket{i}$, the two-photon
transition probability to a final state $\ket{f}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:tpa-prob}
  \begin{split}
    P_{f \leftarrow i} = &\: \: \frac{2 \pi}{\hbar^4}
    \left \lvert
      \sum_a
      \frac{
        \braket{f|\hat{\epsilon}_1 \cdot \bar{D}|a}\braket{a|\hat{\epsilon}_2 \cdot \bar{D}|f}
      }{
        \omega_{ai} - \omega_2 + i \Gamma_a / 2
      } + \frac{
        \braket{f|\hat{\epsilon}_2 \cdot \bar{D}|a}\braket{a|\hat{\epsilon}_1 \cdot \bar{D}|f}
      }{
        \omega_{ai} - \omega_1 + i \Gamma_a / 2
      }
    \right \rvert ^2\\[2mm]
    & \: \: \: \: \: \: \times 
      \frac{1}{\pi} 
      \frac{
        \Gamma_f / 2
      }{
        (\omega_1 + \omega_2 - \omega_{fi})^2+(\Gamma_f/2)^2
      } \frac{
        \omega_1 \omega_2
      }{
        4 \epsilon_0^2 c^4 k_1 k_2
      } \bar{I}_1 \bar{I}_2,\\
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where the index $a$ runs over all intermediate states \cite{bonin84,
  grynberg77}.  In the formula above, $\omega_n = E_n / \hbar$ is the
energy of $\ket{n}$ in units of radians/s, $\omega_{nm} = (E_n -
E_m)/\hbar$ is the energy difference between $\ket{n}$ and $\ket{m}$
in units of radians/s, $\Gamma_n$ is the natural width of $\ket{n}$,
$\hat{\epsilon}_{1,2}$ is the unit polarization vector for each
photon, $k_{1,2}$ is the wave-vector magnitude of each photon, and
$\bar{I}_{1,2}$ is the intensity of each beam.

The following two-photon optical pumping schemes were investigated: 
\renewcommand{\theenumi}{(\alph{enumi})}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\theenumi}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item one color TPA to $7 \; ^3S_1$,
  \item two color TPA to $7 \; ^3S_1$, with one laser tuned to the
    $7 \; ^3S_1 \rightarrow 6 \; ^3P_0$ downward transition,
  \item two color TPA to $7 \; ^3S_1$, using the  3nd harmonic Nd:YAG
    laser output at 355 nm,
  \item one color TPA to $6 \; ^3D_2$, and
  \item two color TPA to $6 \; ^3D_2$, with one laser tuned to the
    $6 \; ^3D_2 \rightarrow 6 \; ^3P_2$ downward transition.
\end{enumerate}
Figure \ref{fig:hg-tpa-levels} shows the various optical pumping
schemes on an energy level diagram for the mercury atom.  For each
scheme, the total transition probability for TPA was calculated using
Equation \ref{eq:tpa-prob}.  The two-photon transition probability
scales with the square of the laser intensity, therefore we give the
probabilities in units of (W/m$^2$)$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$.

The calculated transition probabilites for each scheme are displayed
in Table \ref{table:tpa-prob}.  The one-color, two-photon transition
to the $6 \; ^3D_2$ level, item (d), has the greatest transition
probability among all the two-photon schemes considered.  The two
color transition to $6 \; ^3D_2$, item (e), is slightly weaker.  The
two color, two-photon excitation schemes to the $7 \; ^3S_1$ level,
items (b) and (c), are an order of magnitude weaker yet, and the one
color, two-photon excitation to $7 \; ^3S_1$, item (a), is rigorously
forbidden.

The Hg*($7 \; ^3S_1$) $\leftarrow\leftarrow$ Hg($6 \; ^1S_0$)
two-photon transition is rigorously forbidden according to the
selection rule $J=1 \nleftrightarrow J=0$ for photons of equal
frequency and any relative polarization \cite{bonin84}.  The rule may
be rationalized by considering the interference between quantum
mechanical pathways leading from the initial to final state
\cite{bonin84, grynberg77}.  Figure \ref{fig:hg-forbidden} shows
several of the possible pathways, as well as their relative phases
according to Equation \ref{eq:tpa-prob}.  It can be seen that the
amplitudes for the two different orderings of photon absorption are
equal and opposite.  In fact, experimental verification of this
two-photon selection rule is proposed as a test for the validity of
some fundamental principles of quantum field theory \cite{hilborn02}.

    amplitudes for both orderings of the photons are summed and then
    squared in Equation \ref{eq:tpa-prob}, two-photon transition
    probability is rigorously cancelled by interference between
    alternate excitation pathways. The figure on the left illustrates
    the pathways for left and right circularly polarized photons,
    while the figure to the right illustrates the pathways for
    $z$-polarized and right circularly polarized photons.  The phase

% \section{Theory: A collision model for electronic excitation transfer}

% We base or mercury model on a collisional energy transfer model
% originally developed for the Xe + \ce{N2} system by Ottinger and
% Aquilanti \cite{aquilanti90, aquilanti94}.  

% Polyatomic molecules are typically outside the harpooning limit, due
% to large ionization energies relative to electron affinity.  The first
% ionization limit of acetylene, 11.4 eV, and the electron affinity, ???
% eV, determine that the harpooning radius is ??? $\AA$ in the energy
% region of Hg*($^3P_2$) \cite{ono82}.



% The angular momentum coupling rules for $P$-state atom collisions are
% described by Aquilanti and coworkers \cite{aquilanti80a,
%   aquilanti80b}.  Their formalism is based on the idea of dynamical
% Hund's cases, developed by Nikitin to treat dissociation processes of
% open-shell atoms and molecules \cite{nikitin65}.
% Collisional Hund's cases are classified based on an ordering of the
% magniudes of spin-orbit, rotational, and electrostatic interactions
% between the colliding molecules \cite{nikitin94}.

% The interaction potentials for $^3P_0$ and $^3P_2$ may be estimated
% from those of the $^3P_1$ state \cite{zagrebin95}.  Experiments on HgX
% van der Waals molecules have determined accurate potential surfaces
% for the mercury-excimer states correlated with Hg*($6\;^3P_1$).  The
% potentials derived from such experiments are accurately described in a
% collisional Hund's case (c) basis, based on an ordering of the
% magniudes of spin-orbit, rotational, and electrostatic interactions.

% Interest in the process of mercury photosensitization has led to the
% study of the reaction of Hg $6 \; ^3P_1$ with many species
% \cite{duval91, ohmori96}.  Total cross sections are available for
% acetylene, but electrostatic potential parameters are not available
% from the study of van der Waals molecules \TODO{cite Hg + HCCH cross
%   section paper}.  The interaction between Hg* and acetylene was
% estimated from Hg* + \ce{N2} potentials obtained from the LIF spectrum
% of the \ce{HgN2} van der Waals complex \cite{yamanouchi88}.

% \begin{figure}
%   \caption{Potential energy curves for Hg*($^3P_{2,1,0}$) + \ce{N2}
%     are calculated from the potential parameters for the \ce{HgN2} van
%     der Waals molecule.  The assumption is made that the
%     intermolecular interaction is in the limit of collisional Hund's
%     case ($c$).  This approximation is valid when the intramultiplet
%     splitting in the Hg atom is much larger than the electrostatic
%     interaction.  The quantum number $\Omega$ is the projection of the
%     total electronic angular momentum of the atom, $J$, on the
%     collision axis.  The morse parameters $D_e$ and $r_e$ are given in
%     units of \rcm\ and $\AA$, respectively.  The case ($c$) potentials
%     V$_{J \Omega}$ for $^3P_1$ may be rewritten in terms of case ($a$)
%     potentials, V$_\Sigma$ and V$_\Pi$, from which the case ($c$)
%     potentials for $^3P_{0,2}$ are inferred.}

\section{Experiments: \ce{Xe}* + \ce{N2}}

We investigate the \ce{Xe}* + \ce{N2} system as a precursor to our
experiments with mercury and acetylene.  The xenon-nitrogen system has
the advantage of high excitation energies.  The lowest excited state
of xenon, $^3P_2$, lies 8.3 eV above the ground state
\cite{saloman04}.  The lowest triplet state of nitrogen, $A \;
^3\Sigma_u^+$, while far below Xe*($^3P_2$), lies 6.2 eV above the
ground state \cite{lofthus77}.  (Triplet electronic states of nitrogen
are labeled with uppercase letters for historical reasons.)  The
energies of Xe*($^3P_2$) and \ce{N2}*($A \; ^3\Sigma_u^+$) far exceed
the work function of gold, and both species are extremely metastable
\cite{mishra01, lofthus77}.

Metastable xenon in the $^3P_2$ state transfers electronic energy
selectively into the v'=5 level of \ce{N2}*($B \; ^3\Pi_g$)
\cite{krumpelmann87, krumpelmann88, ottinger95b, aardema94}.  The
fluorescence lifetime of $B \; ^3\Pi_g \rightarrow A \; ^3\Sigma_u^+$
emission is on the order of 10 \microsec\ \cite{lofthus77}.  The $A \;
^3\Sigma_u^+$ state is metastable, with a fluorescence lifetime on the
order of 1 s \cite{lofthus77}.  Thus, visible fluorescence (400$-$500
nm) may be measured to observe absolute quantum yield of the
preparation of metastable \ce{N2}.

The potential energy curves and vibrational levels of the three
``lowest'' energy triplet electronic states of nitrogen are shown in
Figure \ref{fig:n2curves} (adapted from \cite{krumpelmann87}).  The $W
\; ^3\Delta_u$ electronic state is near-degenerate with the $B \;
^3\Pi_g$ state.  Less is known about electronic energy transfer from
Xe into the $W \; ^3\Delta_u$ state of nitrogen, however, the ultimate
decay route is unchanged.  Molecules in the $W \; ^3\Delta_u$ state
decay slowly to the near-degenerate $B \; ^3\Pi_g$ electronic state
via the emission of IR fluorescence.  Shown in the figure for
reference is the energy of the xenon $^3P_2$ state.  Open and closed
circles indicate possible channels for electronic energy transfer, and
arrows indicate the principal fluorescence components
\cite{krumpelmann87}.
% The process proceeds with
% an absolute cross section of 6.5 $\AA^2$ \cite{bohle89}.

\begin{figure}
  \caption{Potential energy curves and vibrational levels of the three
    lowest energy triplet electronic states of nitrogen, \ce{N2}.  The

    ^3\Delta_u$ state decay slowly to the near-degenerate $B \;
    ^3\Pi_g$ electronic state via IR fluorescence.  The fluorescence
    lifetime for $B \; ^3\Pi_g \rightarrow A \; ^3\Sigma_u^+$ emission
    is several \microsec. It is this 400$-$500 nm fluorescence that we
    measure to observe the preparation of metastable \ce{N2}.  Also
    shown in the figure is the energy of the xenon $^3P_2$ state,
    which is known to populate the v'=5 level of the nitrogen $B \;
    ^3\Pi_g$ state in gas-phase collisions \cite{krumpelmann87}.  Less
    is known about electronic energy transfer from Xe into the $W \;
    ^3\Delta_u$ state of nitrogen.  The figure is adapted from
    Reference \cite{krumpelmann-thesis}.}

% Two-photon excitation of xenon atoms is fairly common among atomic
% physicists \cite{alekseev96}. 
One-color TPA to the $^3D_2$ state is used to populate metastable
xenon ($^3P_2$).  The $^3D_2$ state decays spontaneously to $^3P_1$
and $^3P_2$ with a branching ratio of 1:2 \cite{cabrera81}.  The
two-photon transition probability for Xe $^3D_2$ $\leftarrow
\leftarrow$ $^1S_0$ is calculated in the same manner as the Hg
transitions.  A total transition probability of 3.35$\times$10$^{-14}$
(W/m$^2$)$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ is obtained for the one-color TPA.  The
magnitude of the xenon two-photon transition probability is
approximately 1/10th that of the analogous transition in Hg.

The LIF spectrum of the xenon $^3D_2$ $\leftarrow \leftarrow$ $^1S_0$
two-photon transition was recorded first in a static cell (Figure
\ref{fig:xe3d2-cell}) and then in a molecular beam (Figure
\ref{fig:xe-beam}).  The $^3D_2$ $\rightarrow$ $^3P_2$ fluorescence
emission at 823 nm was passed through a colored glass filter and
collected by a Hamamatsu R375 photomultiplier tube.  Emission to the
$^3P_1$ state at 895 nm was outside the wavelength response range of
the photomultiplier.  The fluorescence decay, plotted in the bottom of
Figure \ref{fig:xe-beam}, is consistent with the fluorescence lifetime
of $\tau = 28$ ns reported in the literature \cite{cabrera81}.

Electronic energy transfer to nitrogen molecules was measured first
under static cell conditions.  The excitation chamber of the SEELEM
apparatus was sealed and filled with 210 mTorr of a 50:50 Xe/\ce{N2}
gas mixture.  The laser was held fixed on the \ce{Xe} $^3D_2
\leftarrow \leftarrow ^1S_0$ two-photon transition.  The intensity of
collision-induced \ce{N2} $B \; ^3\Pi_g \rightarrow A \; ^3\Sigma_u^+$
emission in the visible region of the spectrum is plotted in Figure
\ref{fig:xen2-firstlight} as a function of time.  Our observation is
consistent with the reported fluorescence lifetime of \ce{N2} $B \;
^3\Pi_g \rightarrow A \; ^3\Sigma_u^+$ emission, which is on the order
of 10 \microsec.

    with a 50:50 mixture of Xe and \ce{N2}, to a total pressure of 210

To carry out the excitation in the early stages of a supersonic
expansion, a short nozzle extension was constructed.  The extension
piece consisted of a cylinder of stainless steel, 2 cm in length, with
a 1 mm diameter bore.  The piece was tapered at the end to maximize
the exposure at the tip of the orifice to laser radiation.  The nozzle extension
allowed the laser radiation to intersect the free jet in the high
pressure region immediately in front of the nozzle orifice.

The two-photon excitation to Xe ($^3D_2$) was carried out in the
high-pressure region of a supersonic expansion with a 50:50 gas
mixture of Xe and \ce{N2}.  The time dependence of \ce{Xe} $6\;^3D_2

\section{Experiments: \ce{Hg}* + \ce{C2H2}}

The production of Hg*-sensitized metastable molecules in a molecular
beam is more of a challenge than sensitization by Xe*.  Firstly, the
lowest metastable state of Hg, $^3P_0$, is too low in energy to eject
an electron from a gold surface.  Secondly, the only allowed
triplet-triplet transition in acetylene is in the infrared, and the
upper state of the transition, $T_1$, is not detectable even on a
medium-work function metal such as Yttrium.

Another challenge is the generation of large number densities of
mercury in the pulsed nozzle.  The Jordan valve, normally used for
SEELEM experiments, may only be heated to 100\degrees\ C,
corresponding to a mercury vapor pressure of 281 mTorr.  Another
nozzle design, capable of higher temperatures, was needed to achieve
larger partial pressures of Hg inside the nozzle.  Heated continuous
beam sources of Hg*($^3P_0$) are reported in the literature
\cite{haberman75, obi83}.  Nitrogen backing gas is first bubbled
through a mercury oven, and the resulting gas mixture is expanded
through a heated nozzle, next to an embedded Hg resonance lamp.
However, we require a pulsed design, due to pump speed limitations.

A new pulsed valve was designed by Wilton Virgo in 2007 to meet our
demands for heated mercury.  The design is based on a pulsed valve
used by the Leutwyler research group at the University of Bern,
Switzerland \cite{tanner06, mueller99}.  The valve can be heated to
250\degrees\ C, corresponding to a mercury vapor pressure of 75 Torr.
A diagram of the ``Bern Valve'' is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:bern-diagram}.

\begin{figure}
  \caption{Diagram of the heated pulsed valve developed for
    experiments with mercury.  The ``Bern Valve'' can be safely heated

We attempted to populate the $^3P_0$ level of mercury via collisional
intramultiplet relaxation by \ce{N2} molecules.  Nitrogen is known to
efficiently quench Hg*($^3P_1$) to Hg*($^3P_0$), because the
$^3P_1-^3P_0$ energy difference is about the same as the vibrational
level spacing in \ce{N2} \cite{callear70, horiguchi71, mitchell61}.
Bras and coworkers meaured the energy transfer dynamics of mercury in
\ce{N2} buffer gas, and determined that Hg($^3P_0$) may be efficiently
produced by two-photon excitation to the $7 \; ^1S_0$ level, followed
by radiative $7 \; ^1S_0$ $\rightarrow$ $^3P_1$ decay and collisional
$^3P_1$ $\rightarrow$ $6 \; ^3P_0$ quenching \cite{bras93}.

The relatively strong one-color, two-photon transition Hg $7 \; ^1S_0$
$\leftarrow\leftarrow$ $6 \; ^1S_0$ was recorded under static cell
conditions.  However, the excitation energy of Hg*($^3P_0$) is below
the work function of gold.  A yttrium surface was tested in an effort
to develop a lower work function SEELEM detector.  In a collaborative
project with Trevor Sears, we installed a commercially available
sample (Alfa Aesar) of yttrium foil on our SEELEM detector, and
measured the SEELEM-TOF spectra of metastable phenylacetylene
molecules \cite{hofstein08}.  SEELEM-TOF spectra were recorded for
several vibrational bands of the phenylacetylene $\tilde{A}$ state.
Most of the bands, labeled here according to their approximate
frequency above the $\tilde{A}$ state origin, have been assigned by
Powers and coworkers \cite{powers81}.  The SEELEM-TOF spectra of
phenylacetylene levels are plotted together in Figure
\ref{fig:phenylacetylene-tofs}.  Unfortunately, we were not able to
maintain the detector in a reliable state of operation with a yttrium
surface, due to degredation of the electron multiplier front plate
surface.  We turned to methods for creating Hg($^3P_2$).

\begin{figure}
  \caption{SEELEM-TOF spectra of several vibrational bands of
    $\tilde{A}$ phenylacetylene.  Yttrium was used as a low work
    function surface in the experiment.  The excitation laser was
    tuned to the frequency of highest intensity in each band.  The
    bands are labeled according to their frequency above the
    $\tilde{A}$ state origin.}

Following our success with xenon, we attempted to use the $6\;^3D_2
\leftarrow \leftarrow 6\;^1S_0$ one-color, two-photon transition to
create mercury atoms in the $^3P_2$ state.  The LIF spectrum of this
transition, recorded in a static cell, is plotted in Figure
\ref{fig:hg3d2-cell}.  An interference filter was used to record only
the $6 \; ^3D_2 \rightarrow ^3P_2$ fluorescence at 365 nm.  The
experiment was attempted in a supersonic expansion, prior to the time
that the Bern valve was manufactured.  We were unable to achieve a
sufficient number density of Hg atoms to measure a signal in the free
jet.

    two-photon transition \ce{Hg} $6\;^3D_2 \leftarrow \leftarrow

    results from spontaneous emission to the metastable $6\;^3P_2$
    state at 365 nm.}

Direct excitation to the $^3P_2$ state was also attempted as a method
for triplet formation.  This transition, while forbidden in the
solitary molecule, is made allowed in collision complexes with a
variety of gases \cite{kurosawa98, amano98}.  Also, we note that weak
$^3P_2$ $\rightarrow$ $6 \; ^1S_0$ emission was observed in pre-laser
experiments \cite{mrozowski45}.  Figure \ref{fig:hg-3p2-direct} shows
the SEELEM-TOF spectrum of mercury excited to directly to the $6 \;
^3P_2$ level.  The signal level is sufficiently low that it is checked
against a repeated experiment with the pulsed valve turned off, shown
for comparison in Figure \ref{fig:hg-3p2-direct-bg}.  While it is
clear that we do register a SEELEM signal from the direct excitation
of Hg*($6 \; ^3P_2$), we were not able to increase the gas density
sufficiently at the point of excitation to make this an efficient
process for the population of acetylene metastables.

We found that the most efficient method for the population of
Hg*($^3P_2$) was a simple, two step excitation to $7 \; ^3S_1$ via the
$^3P_1$ level.  
% The use of the 254 nm Hg resonance line did not result
% in deposition of a polymer when this experiment was carried out with
% acetylene in a pulsed supersonic expansion.  
Figure \ref{fig:hg-twostep} shows a simultaneously recorded LIF and
SEELEM spectrum for mercury seeded in xenon gas.  The frequency of one
laser was fixed to the Hg $7 \; ^3S_1$ $\leftarrow$ $^3P_1$ atomic
transition, while another was scanned in the region of the $^3P_1
\leftarrow ^1S_0$ transition.  An interference filter was used to
record only $7 \; ^3S_1$ $\rightarrow$ $^3P_2$ emission, which results
in the population of metastable Hg atoms.  The SEELEM spectrum detects
the metastables that survive a 700 \microsec\ flight time.  The
hyperfine structure of several Hg isotopes is apparent from the
lineshape in the spectrum.

    $\rightarrow$ Hg($^3P_2$) emission, which results in the

After the observation of metastable Hg*($^3P_2$) formed in the
two-step excitation, the measurement was repeated, using acetylene as
the buffer gas.  The resulting SEELEM spectrum of the two-color,
stepwise excitation of Hg($^3S_1$) via the $^3P_1$ level is plotted in
Figure \ref{fig:hg-twostep-c2h2}.  The lower-intensity spectrum shows
mercury seeded in Xe gas, while the upper spectrum shows mercury
seeded in acetylene.  We attribute the larger overall signal level for
the mercury/acetylene mixture to electronic excitation transfer
between Hg($^3P_2$) and \ce{C2H2}($T_3$).

\section{Future Work}

We propose a new experiment, building on the success of our previous
work with the Xe* + \ce{N2} system.  The experiment would study the
rotational and vibrational depenence of collision-induced intersystem
crossing from the $a' \; ^1\Sigma_u^-$ and $a \; ^1\Pi_g$ states to
the $B \; ^3\Pi_g$ state of nitrogen.  Nitrogen may be excited to the
$a \; ^1\Pi_g$ state via two-photon transitions \cite{vanveen82}.
Collisions between \ce{N2} molecules facilitate energy transfer
between the $a \; ^1\Pi_g$ and $a' \; ^1\Sigma_u^-$ electronic states
\cite{marinelli88}.  The $a \; ^1\Pi_g$ $\leftrightarrow$ $a' \;
^1\Sigma_u^-$ processes may be studied using ``traditional''
LIF/SEELEM spectroscopy, perhaps with a longer pathlength for the
SEELEM detector.  The fluorescence lifetime of the $a \; ^1\Pi_g$
state is on the order of $10^{-4}$ s -- this fluorescence may be
viewed directly, using a long time window.  The lifetime of $a' \;
^1\Sigma_u^-$ is on the order of $10^{-2}$ s -- molecules in this
electronic state may be detected in the SEELEM channel.

Xenon-nitrogen collisions are observed to facilitate the process of
collisional $a' \; ^1\Sigma_u^-$ $\rightarrow$ $B \; ^3\Pi_g$
intersystem crossing, although the rotational and vibrational
dependences of this process are uncertain \cite{umemoto03a}.  The
intersystem crossing process would be readily observable via $B \;
^3\Pi_g \rightarrow A \; ^3\Sigma_u^+$ fluorescence in the visible
region of the spectrum.

In separate experiments, Ottinger has observed collision-induced
``gateway'' intersystem crossing, which is attributed to an accidental
near-degeneracy between $a' \; ^1\Sigma_u^-, v=16, J=14$ and $C \;
^3\Pi_u, v=0, J=14$ \cite{ottinger98}.  The gateway process is
\emph{quenched} in collisions with Xe atoms.  Ottinger proposes that
the energy of the $a' \; ^1\Sigma_u^-, v=16$ state is high enough that
the quenching reaction proceeds according to a harpooning mechanism,
which efficiently produces Xe* \cite{ottinger98}.

A rapid change in the chemistry of Xe + \ce{N2}($a' \; ^1\Sigma_u^-$)
collisions as the vibrational level is changed from $v=0$ to $v=14$
makes this experiment an exciting proposition.  Two-photon laser
excitation of \ce{N2} will allow rotational and vibrational effects in
nitrogen to be studied selectively.  Furthermore, a range of detection
options are available in the current apparatus for the reaction
products Xe* and \ce{N2}*.

\section{Conclusions}

We demonstrate the production of metastable acetylene and nitrogen
molecules in a molecular beam by the method of collisional electronic
excitation.  Metastable atoms, populated by two-photon transitions
followed by spontaneous emission, are used as the energy-carrying
collision partners.
